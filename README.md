# Project Description

We are building a platform like ProductHunt named "SourceHunt" for the open-source community where people (Maintainers and Founders) from different organizations can list their organizations, and Contributors from different regions can learn more about the organization's ecosystem, opportunities they get if they contribute to those specific organizations, the past open-source programs in which organization has participated (programs like GSoC, LFX, polygon fellowship) and many more via this platform. We have brainstormed about the monetizing scheme of this project, and we listed down some unique features related to user profile, open-source jobs, leaderboard (acc to issues solving, and number of PRs), one-on-one mentorship from open-source contributors, issue hunt, organizations promotion (just like product hunt do for listed products) and many more, we can make developers profile like peerlist and other platforms like showcase and reward and support developers with crypto and NFTs according to there performance and solving of a critical issue in web 3 open-source orgs.

## Dockerfile and StackOS
 We have a working Dockerfile for the project and also is uploaded on StackOS. StackOS gives decentralized cloud services for Web3. Then we deployed it on StackOS and uses the Router for the payments methods.

#Flutter Application
Reef Protocol uses Web View to render the application on the flutter framework and flutter web application currenlty do not support web View hence we are keeping the mobile application version ready for this demo and will migrate to the web application once the support is available
The mobile application supports the wallet integration with the application can now fetch the data through the javascript RPC api and a flutter repository to expose all the function. The application offers a functionality to the interact with different open source organisation. The application does it state management through MOBX and following the best practice to improve the performace and increase the efficiency of the project. The idea is to reward the developers REEF token and building the ecosystem for the REEF community for the REEF protocol itself.  The application is deployed on the StackOS and uses the Router for the payments methods.

### Date of starting the project : 26 November, 2022
